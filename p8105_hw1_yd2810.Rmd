```

## Problem 1

```{r}
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")

var_names <- names(early_january_weather)

n_obs <- nrow(early_january_weather)
n_vars <- ncol(early_january_weather)
```

The `early_january_weather` dataset records hourly meteorological data for LGA, JFK and EWR for the month of January 2013. It consists of `r n_obs` observations and `r n_vars` variables including `r var_names`.



```{r}
mean_temp <- mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

The mean temperature is `r mean_temp` Â°F.

```{r}
weather_plot <- 
  ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour ,y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Time",
       y = "Temperature in F",
       color = "humidity",
       title = "Temperature over time")

weather_plot
```

Export the scatterplot

```{r}
ggsave("scatter_temp_time.png",weather_plot,height = 4,width = 6)
```
